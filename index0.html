						<h1>Personal Information</h1>
					</div>

					<div class="sectionContent">
						<p>My name is Theodore I am 34 years old. I am a dual citizen (Australian/American) I spent most
							of my earlier years growing up in the USA before moving to Australia permanently.</p>

						<p>I enjoy playing video games, I like to go fishing a few times a month from sunrise to
							sunset, if I had a garage big enough and the time I would love to take on an older car
							restoration in my spare time although this is unlikely between work, enrolling in the
							course, and spending time with my wife and 8 month old. My wife is Vietnamese and we plan to
							teach our son Vietnamese and of course English, although I know a little Vietnamese now I
							will continue to learn alongside my son to improve my understanding of the language and open
							up new possibilities for myself and my family, and lastly I have a strong interest in
							aquaponics and when I am able to own my own home I plan to set up a garden using an
							aquaponics system.</p>

					<div class="sectionContent">
						<p>My interest in IT currently is around programming even though I have minimal exposure I have
							a goal that I have set for myself and the only thing that may sway my decision may possibly
							be cyber security. My interest started when I was very young, I tore everything apart
							looking to see how it works and most of the time I managed to put it back together without
							any issues. I do not believe there was any event or person that sparked my interest only
							that I have always been curious from science and technology to staring at the stars.</p>

					<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<article>
						<h2>DevOps Engineer</h2>

						<h3>Job Description</h3>
						<p>My ideal job would be to become a DevOps Engineer as this is currently in the line with my
							goal of focusing on programming, not only do you code but in this position, you collaborate
							between the overall needs of the company, development, and deployment of software needed. I
							believe no two days will feel the same and I would hate to feel like I was in a stale or
							non-engaging work environment.</p>
						<h3>Skills I have</h3>
						<p>My current skills revolve around warehousing and physical aspects of the job market, I have a
							few licenses to perform high-risk work like that you may encounter in a warehouse
							environment as well as management experience.</p>
						<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
						<p>The skills required are the ability to communicate, mediate between the software and
							operations teams, the ability to be impartial, coding and scripting skills, cloud services,
							testing and debugging, automation technology, and the ability to also be a self-starter or
							proactive.</p>
						<h3>Learning Plan</h3>

					<h3>16 Personalities</h3>
					<p>My results from the Myers-Briggs test are also quite accurate and mirror my results
						from
						personality max, to be honest I am not surprised by them at all and I guess the only
						thing that I could improve on is being more confident in who I am and the ability to
						say
						no to others without feeling guilty.</p>
					<embed src="img/16personalities.pdf" width="720px" height="700px" />
					<h3>Big Five Test</h3>
					<p>My results from the Bigfive Test are also pretty accurate and although I will not go into
						detail the majority of what I read is true with only a few things I disagree on such as
						friendliness, I am overly friendly and this is what has more than likely contributed to
						the way I am now in that I have been taken advantage of too often and too many times
						that I no longer wish to try to find any friends for the fear of being let down once
						again, although I would love to have a genuine friend, my energy will go into improving
						my way of life and my family's future.</p>
					<embed src="img/Bigfivetest.pdf" width="720px" height="700px" />
					<h3>Personality Max</h3>
					<p>My results from Personality Max hits the nail on the head as far as my learning style, I
						have never been a very good learner when it comes to auditory as I find without doing it
						myself or at least watching another person that I have endless questions as I hate to do
						things multiple times but would rather spend the little extra time to get it right the
						first time with a high degree of detail. </p>
					<embed src="img/personality max.pdf" width="720px" height="700px" />
					<h3>Team Composition</h3>
					<p>Given my test results I have shared my thoughts on them above, the results may not
						influence me in a team although I may have a hard time trusting others. What I must take
						into account when forming a team is to find others who excel in the areas that I may be
						lacking or not capable of completing to a professional level when certain aspects are
						not particularly one of my strengths. </p>

						<h1>Project Idea</h1>
					</div>

					<div class="sectionContent">
						<article>
							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>My proposed project idea is to create a hydroponic setup that uses AI to monitor,
								maintain (to an extent), and automate tasks that would otherwise be labor-intensive
								requiring additional staff or resources. The project would not initially be
								solar-powered although this would be the main goal after successful trials in the
								automation of the hydroponic environment and would ultimately be run on Stand-alone
								renewable energy. With the increase in temperatures, pests, and frequency of droughts,
								new ideas or technologies must be applied to grow food not only to put less stress on
								the environment but to reduce our need for traditional farming methods.
						</article>

						<article>
							<h2>Motivation</h2>
							<p>The motivation behind this idea is to reduce the strain on the environment, the need to
								import foreign produce, and becoming less reliant on pesticides. Hydroponic creates
								better growing conditions, fewer pests and diseases, and of course higher yields.
								Hydroponics can be grown indoors and you can scale vertically to reduce the overall
								footprint when compared to traditional farming. I believe going this route and
								replanting farmland with trees and other beneficial plants will have a long-term impact
								on the continuous rise in temperatures and to do this we need to use multiple
								technologies to achieve the desired outcome.</p>
						</article>

						<article>
							<h2>Description</h2>
							<p>Hydroponics has the ability to change the way we not only see food but also may provide
								us with better produce with less wastage due to damaging pests and diseases.
								The following are several types of growing techniques that hydroponics uses:
							<ul>
								<li>Nutrient Film Technique (NFT)</li>
								<li>Deep Water Culture (DWC)</li>
								<li>Wick system</li>
								<li>Ebb and Flow</li>
								<li>Drip System</li>
								<li>Aeroponics</li>
								<li>The Kratky Method</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							The two main and most cost-effective methods are NFT and DWC and the following detail each
							method making them commercially viable.
						</article>
						<p></p>
						<ul>
							• NFT <ul>
								<li>Technique involves a shallow stream of water with a constant flow past the roots of
									the plant.</li>
								<li>Generally uses piping with a slight grade to allow the water to flow downhill.</li>
								<li>Piping holds the grow trays which typically contain the growing medium.</li>
								<li>A reservoir.</li>
								<li>Pump</li>
								<li>The use of tubing/piping in the form of a return system as well as distribution</li>
							</ul>
							• DWC<ul>
								<li>Simple design and ease of setup</li>
								<li>Use of indoor ponds</li>
								<li>Foam rafts that hold the plants</li>
								<li>Grow trays with usually Rockwool or other similar grow medium</li>
								<li>Water is oxygenated through air pumps or recirculation</li>
							</ul>
							<p>To grow in any hydroponic setup you must understand NPK ratios, pH levels, and water
								temperature for a start. The pH in the system should be kept between 5.0-6.0 as drops
								below 5.0 may result in several deficiencies or even levels of toxicity. NPK
								(Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium) ratio as an example 8-11-7 is 8% nitrogen, 11 %
								phosphorus, 7% potassium, and the remaining solution is made up of micronutrients.
								Plants like a certain balance of these nutrients and may work well for one plant and not
								as great for the next, finding a balance is key. Systems should also ensure the solution
								is oxygenated whether naturally through water exchange or air pumps as this is one
								factor that drives root growth.</p>

							<p>There are also other factors to consider such as lighting and airflow, if you are not
								using a greenhouse, you need special lighting to reproduce the light spectrum and fans
								to keep airflow over the plants which also helps to aid in making the plants stronger
								and keeping things such as mold and fungal growth at bay.</p>
							<p>Although startup costs may be high, the type of crops you would like to produce
								ultimately influence the hydroponic method and have the potential to grow year-round
								increasing your production rate. If we use tomatoes for example, traditional farming may
								use as much as 300 liters of water to produce 1kg of tomatoes whereas under ideal
								conditions in an advanced closed greenhouse is as little as 4 liters is needed to
								produce 1kg of tomatoes.</p>
							<p>Another advantage is certain methods such as NPT enable growing to go vertically
								increasing the yield per meter ratio without the need for a massive investment in land.
								The goal is to produce as much as possible and leave as little of a footprint on the
								environment around us, while also providing the produce needed to sustain our economy
								and communities.</p>

							</article>

							<article>
								<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
								<p>Several tools/equipment are needed in order for this to work, pumps, aerators, ponds,
									piping/tubing are some of the basic ones. The technology that I would like to
									introduce are sensors, an open-source software to manage/organize the data collected
									by the sensors(light, pH, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, AI algorithms to calculate the most
									efficient lighting patterns if LED’s are used in the setup, monitor pH levels, and
									keeping the NPK ratio at its optimum depending on the crop being produced.</p>
								<P>The use of open-source software such as Mycodo which runs on hardware such as
									Raspberry Pi, Mycodo collects data from sensors and may be configured in a way to
									take commands from Linux or Python with the potential to semi-automate the
									hydroponic setup.</P>
							</article>

							<article>
								<h2>Skills Required</h2>
								<p>The skills required for an initial setup are not too complicated, but the more
									automation and AI that goes into the project would take quite a bit of knowledge and
									skill to accomplish the end goal. This would take quite a bit of research to see how
									each type of produce responds to light configurations, flow, nutrient levels, and is
									compiled into optimum growth with the average harvest rate for a start, this then
									could be compiled in Python to monitor and automate systems. I would need some
									programming background, more technical knowledge of sensors, otherwise, I would need
									to expand beyond my skills and find someone more qualified to assist me in my
									project.</p>
								<p>Small scale I would use Mycodo as my software and Raspberry Pi as the hardware
									besides the obvious sensors etc. The longer the project or the rate in which I would
									achieve a success rate would then push me into looking for potential investors to
									get the project into the next stages and introduce a more advanced system regarding
									hardware and software.</p>
							</article>

							<article>
								<h2>Outcome</h2>
								<p>If the project was successful as well as viable I would seek to find investors to
									continue the project on a bigger scale. The original problem may not be completely
									solved although what would be accomplished are the following:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Higher produce yields
									<li>Considerably less water consumption
									<li>Smaller land footprint
									<li>Faster seed to harvest
									<li>Year-round production
									<li>Minimal pests and diseases leading to less wastage
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>This may also open the door to creating proprietary software using all the data
									collected if I found that the open-source software did not cover all the areas
									needed for the continuation of the project.</p>
